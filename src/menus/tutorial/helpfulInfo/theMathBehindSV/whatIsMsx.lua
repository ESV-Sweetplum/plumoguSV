In real life, a meter is defined by the distance light travels in 1/299792458th of a second. Of course, in Quaver, we have much more control over how things move, so we can simply write that 1 msx is the distance a note travels in 1 millisecond at 1x scroll velocity. We can generalize this with the equation:")

We use this fact to compute msx in any constant velocity scenario:")
